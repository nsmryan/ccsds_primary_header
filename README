# ccsds_primary_header
This crate contains an implementation of the CCSDS standard
called Space Packet Protocol, which defines a packet header
called the CCSDS Primary Header.


CCSDS is a packet definition used in space systems, such as the
International Space Station. It is very simple, and expects
the user to extend it with additional information in most
applications. 


This crate will provide only a simple implementation of the
primary header. It is intended to be used as a building
block for larger definitions or packet processing tools.

The PrimaryHeader struct provided by the crate has the
advantage that its in-memory representation matches the
CCSDS standard. This way, it can be cast to a from a 
byte array, sent over a wire, or used to serialize or
deserialze CCSDS packets.
