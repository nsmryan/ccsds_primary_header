# ccsds_primary_header
This repo contains what I hope will become a Rust crate
for parsing CCSDS packet headers.


CCSDS is a packet definition used in space systems, such as the
International Space Station. It is very simple, and expects
the user to extend it with additional information in most
applications.


This crate will provide only a simple implementation of the
primary header. It is intended to be used as a building
block for larger definitions or packet processing tools.
